diabetes project is a group project made by 4 students which I am a part of. 
It is our final project for Biomedical Engineering bachelor's program.
Abstract:
We developed a program on matlab with Pima indian dataset. By considering the
features such as Pregnancies (Number of Pregnancies), Glucose (Amount of Glucose),
Blood Pressure (Blood Pressure), Skin Thickness (Skin Thickness), Insulin (Amount of
Insulin), BMI (Body Mass Number), Diabetes Pedigree Funciton (Diabetes Pedigree
Based on the characteristics of the relationship) and Age (Age), the program will
assume whether there is a diabetic patient or not in the colony of Indians with accuracy
that can be considered successful.
