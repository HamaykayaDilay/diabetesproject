This project was done in collaboration with 3 other students. It was our final project in our Biomedical Engineering bachelor's program. 
Abstract: We developed a model using Matlab with the Pima Indian dataset. By considering the features such as Pregnancies (Number of Pregnancies), Glucose (Amount of Glucose), Blood Pressure (Blood Pressure), Skin Thickness (Skin Thickness), Insulin (Amount of Insulin), BMI (Body Mass Number), Diabetes Pedigree Function (Diabetes Pedigree Based on the characteristics of the relationship) and Age (Age), the program will predict whether there is a diabetic patient or not in the colony of Indians with an accuracy that can be considered successful.
